# Where's Waldo?

This is a simple implementation of the known game **_Where's Waldo/Wally?_** that most of us know and probably have played at some point in our lives.
It has a high score implementation so you can see how fast you were, and who was faster than you even.

I've used React for the front end, for the Backend I used Express and MongoDB with Mongoose. A really basic implementation, plenty of room for improvement.

## Live Demo

You can play the game [here](https://daniel-ulises.github.io/Waldo/#/waldo)
